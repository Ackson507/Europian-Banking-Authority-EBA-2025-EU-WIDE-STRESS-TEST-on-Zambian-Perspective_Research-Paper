### Stress Testing
The concept of stress testing originated in the engineering and scientific fields, where it was used to test the durability and limits of materials, structures, or systems under extreme conditions. For example, engineers might stress-test a bridge to see how much weight it can bear before collapsing. Stress testing is a risk management tool used to evaluate how a system, institution, or economy performs under extreme but plausible adverse conditions. In the financial and economic context, stress testing gained prominence after the 2007–2008 global financial crisis, since the crisis, many countries have expanded their toolkits to explore a more systemic approach to financial regulation and supervision. This holistic approach is called Macroprudential Policy.

### Stress Test: ZAMBIA’S PERSPECTIVE ON THE 2025 EU-WIDE STRESS TEST 
By studying the EBA’s practices, Zambia can learn, and modify the design and implementation of effective stress-testing frameworks tailored to its financial systemin the sense that as global and regional financial systems become more interconnected, Zambia must align its practices with international standards to participate effectively in global markets. 

Before we move on to the main subject of the topic let us briefly describe Zambia’s macroeconomic indicators, starting with population trends, which are crucial for understanding the country’s economic and social dynamics.
