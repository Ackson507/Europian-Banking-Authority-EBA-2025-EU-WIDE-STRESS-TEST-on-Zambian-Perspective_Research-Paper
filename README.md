### Stress Testing
The concept of stress testing originated in the engineering and scientific fields, where it was used to test the durability and limits of materials, structures, or systems under extreme conditions. For example, engineers might stress-test a bridge to see how much weight it can bear before collapsing. Stress testing is a risk management tool used to evaluate how a system, institution, or economy performs under extreme but plausible adverse conditions. In the financial and economic context, stress testing gained prominence after the 2007–2008 global financial crisis, since the crisis, many countries have expanded their toolkits to explore a more systemic approach to financial regulation and supervision. This holistic approach is called Macroprudential Policy.

### Stress Test: ZAMBIA’S PERSPECTIVE ON THE 2025 EU-WIDE STRESS TEST 
By studying the EBA’s practices, Zambia can learn, and modify the design and implementation of effective stress-testing frameworks tailored to its financial systemin the sense that as global and regional financial systems become more interconnected, Zambia must align its practices with international standards to participate effectively in global markets. 

Before we move on to the main subject of the topic let us briefly describe Zambia’s macroeconomic indicators, starting with population trends, which are crucial for understanding the country’s economic and social dynamics.

Zambia’s population has grown significantly over the past five decades, from 4.1 million in 1969 to 19.7 million in 2022. The annual population growth rate has remained relatively high, averaging around 3% per year over the past few decades, this is significantly higher than the global average, reflecting Zambia’s young population and high fertility rates.The forecasted population of 26.5 million by 2032 underscores the importance of ensuring financial stability in Zambia. A growing population means more people will need access to financial services, such as savings accounts, loans, and insurance. The financial sector must expand and innovate to meet this demand. Failure to do so could lead to financial exclusion, which can hinder economic growth and stability.

If the government cannot meet these demands, it may resort to excessive borrowing, leading to higher public debt and potential fiscal instability. A stable financial system is essential to support sustainable public finances.




### Stress Test: METHODOLOGY

To conduct an effective stress test, especially one as comprehensive as the 2025 EU-wide stress test, a systematic and well-structured approach is required. In this research, we will explore and in detail study the 2025 EU-wide stress test framework. This involves several steps, from defining scenarios to integrating data and generating results. Below is a detailed breakdown of the process, including the macro indicators used, models applied, bank information required, and how these elements are integrated to produce actionable results. Then will define and build the the similar stress test framework in Zambian Pespective using similar criteria stated below.

i.	Define Objectives and Scope

ii.	Design Scenarios. 

iii.	Collect and Prepare Data. 

iv.	Develop and Apply Models. 

v.	Run Simulations.

vi.	Generate Reports and Recommendations.
